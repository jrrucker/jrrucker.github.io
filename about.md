I’m a software Engineer at Interactive Intelligence in Durham, NC.

As a 2010 graduate of NC State, I started building web applications during a 2006 internship, building finance reporting interfaces for Boyles Furniture, a small furniture distributor based out of Conover, NC. My time at Boyles was followed by an internship with Klingspor Abrasives, an international sandpaper manufacturer with U.S. operations based out of Hickory, NC and stint as a student web developer for ITECS, a support unit for the College of Engineering.

In 2009, I left ITECS to take a full-time consulting role for a small startup called OneWorks developing public and internal interfaces for clients primarily IBM iSeries and JDEdwards or HarrisData ERPs in PHP and asp.NET in addition to supporting OneWorks TimeKeeper, a time clock application for Windows CE that leveraged various HID technologies such as biometrics and RFID.

I returned to NC State in 2011 hoping to improve upon the web experiences that haunted me for the better part of a decade. I was named the senior web developer in November of 2012. In March 2014, I left NC State to take my current position at Interactive Intelligence.

When I’m not at work, I spend my time with wife and cats. I enjoy photography and spending way too much time in movie theaters.
